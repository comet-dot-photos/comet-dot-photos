# Comet.Photos

Comet.Photos allows for fast spatial search of images from the Rosetta comet mission, specifically images from Osiris' Narrow Angle Camera, which provide the most detailed images of Comet 67P. Users of Comet.Photos can paint a region of interest on a 3D model of the comet, optionally specifying various lighting / geometry parameters, and in a fraction of a second, all matching images are found and made available for browsing, either projected onto the comet 3D shape model, or in their original 2D form.

There are two different usage options for Comet.Photos. People who expect to make frequent use of the software for their research are encouraged to install the program locally on their computer for best performance, with seemingly instantaneous feedback. However, people casually interested in trying out Comet.Photos can access the latest version at https://comet.photos to take it out for a spin.
